# Skynet-IADS
An IADS (Integrated Air Defence System) script for DCS (Digital Combat Simulator).

# Abstract
This script simulates an IADS within the scripting possibilities of DCS. Early Warning Radar Stations (EW Radar) scan the sky for contacts. These contacts are correlated with SAM (Surface to Air Missile) Sites. If a contact is within firing range of the the SAM Site it will become active. A modern IADS also depends on Command Centers and datalink to the SAM Sites. The IADS can be set up with this infrastructure. Destroying it will degrade the capability of the IADS.
